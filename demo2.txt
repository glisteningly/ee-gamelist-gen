game: Aggressors of Dark Kombat
file: aodk.zip
developer: ADK
publisher: SNK
genre: Fight / Versus, Fight
description:
  Aggressors of Dark Kombat is another one-on-one street fighting beat 'em up from
  the Neo-Geo's seemingly endless library of fighters.
  .
  It pits 8 fighters of different styles and strengths against each other in a
  tournament to see who's the toughest mofo on the streets of Tokyo. Your
  objective as usual is to deplete your opponent's health bar within the time
  limit by using your basic attacks and special moves (triggered by specific
  controller motions) while avoiding his moves and attacks.
  .
  Unique to Aggressors of Dark Kombat is the combination of traditional
  side-scrolling beat 'em up elements, meaning characters can freely move in an
  isometric space instead of being restricted to a single plane of movement.
  Weapons and throw-able items are usually thrown into the arena by the crowds and
  you can pick them up and wield them for added damage. Additionally, matches are
  1-round only affairs, with an extended multi-layered health bar that allows for
  longer rounds than usual.

  Karate, and also because Ryo refused to work for Big. After Ryo & Robert defeat
  Mr. Big, they face the enigmatic Mr. Karate. Art of Fighting's story ends with a

  In this sequel to the original Art of Fighting, and prequel to the original

  was being used by Geese Howard for his own evil intentions, and that Mr. Big was
  the one who had originally kidnapped Yuri.

  or Robert to choose from in 1 player mode, etc.).

  Todo and Mr. Karate), along with a few new characters: Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo and
  Yuri's father; Yuri Sakazaki, Takuma's daughter and Ryo's sister; Eiji Kisaragi,
  a sworn enemy of the Sakazakis; Temjin, a Mongolian trucker; and a younger

  The traditional fighting system comes with sensible modifications, like the
  removal of both "Rank System" (SSS, SS, S, AAA etc.) and ground breakable
  objects. The match system using 2 battle plans (foreground/background) remains
  semi-intact, because now some battle fields (like Cheng Sinzan's stage) uses a
  single plane, forcing the players to use only the basic defense to avoid
  attacks.

  But the main addition of this title (and the reason for subtitle "The
  Newcomers") are 2 new characters entering for Fatal Fury's main cast: Rick
  Strowd, a mysterious fighter with a particular fighting style and Li Xiangfei, a
  young female Chinese martial arts fighter.

  The overall gameplay was slightly altered. It is a little faster, and the
  Slash/Bust system has been removed. Each character now has only one version, or
  the Bust mode is simply replaced by a new character of very similar setup. Combo
  slashes, sidestepping and fatalities have also vanished. The basic moves have

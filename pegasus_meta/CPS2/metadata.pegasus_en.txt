  In a time when the industrialization of the world had just begun, various

  electricity to re-rotate it. It was called 'The Professional Gear', or just
  'Progear'. This invention was the key to conquer the great wide open sky.
  Another discovery made the ancient dream of the immortal body come true. But it
  was affordable only by some wealthy elderly. They formed a new council called
  'the Motorouin' and declared the current government as a corruptive and greedy
  establishment and that they want to correct it by a new educational system, in
  order to create a new race of man. So they built a military force to realize the
  first step of their plan, which was the takeover of the kingdom. The government
  decided to stop the aggression by putting it's own army in motion. It was a
  dreadful battle with many victims. But it was won by the Motorouin. This battle
  is mentioned in the books of history as 'The Punishment of the Sages'.

  A group of young pilots, actually children whose families were killed in that
  war, finally decided to fight back. They secretly developed a new powerful
  weapon which adults were not able to use. They called it 'Gun Flyer' and
  installed it in all of their planes. The Storm of Progear was about to begin!
